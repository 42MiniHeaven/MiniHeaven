2. 40-day roadmap (realistic & calm)

Think in weekly goals, not “finish minishell”.

🟩 Week 1 (Days 1–7): Environment core

Goal: Environment works perfectly, no execution yet

Day 1–2

Decide env structure:

typedef struct s_env {
    char *key;
    char *value;
    struct s_env *next;
} t_env;


Convert envp → linked list

Functions:

env_new

env_add_back

env_find

env_to_envp

✅ Win condition: You can print env reliably

Day 3

env builtin

Error handling & formatting

Day 4–5

export

With args

Without args (sorted output)

unset

Day 6

Variable expansion logic:

$VAR

$?

Keep it isolated from parsing

Day 7

Refactor & tests

No new features, only cleanup

🧠 At this point: you have a mini environment manager

🟦 Week 2 (Days 8–14): Builtins

Goal: All builtins work without pipes

Day 8

echo (-n handling)

pwd

Day 9

cd

OLDPWD

HOME

Error cases

Day 10

exit

Numeric validation

Exit status rules

Day 11

Builtin dispatcher:

int is_builtin(char *cmd);
int exec_builtin(t_cmd *cmd, t_env **env);


Day 12–13

Test builtins thoroughly

Match bash behavior (42 expectations)

Day 14

Refactor & freeze builtins

🧠 You now have commands that behave like bash internally

🟨 Week 3 (Days 15–21): Execution basics

Goal: Single command execution works

Day 15

fork + execve

Path resolution (PATH)

Day 16

Redirections:

<

>

>>

File descriptor handling

Day 17

Builtins without fork

External commands with fork

Day 18

Exit status management

$? correctness

Day 19–20

Cleanup on error

Memory & FD leaks

Day 21

Refactor execution logic

🟥 Week 4 (Days 22–28): Pipes & combinations

Goal: Real shell behavior

Day 22

Pipe basics: cmd1 | cmd2

Day 23

Multiple pipes

Day 24

Pipes + redirections

Day 25

Builtins in pipes (forked!)

Day 26–27

Edge cases

Bash comparison testing

Day 28

Heavy refactor day

🟪 Week 5 (Days 29–35): Stability & polish

Goal: Make it solid and evaluatable

Signals behavior (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, Ctrl-)

Norm compliance

Error messages

Stress tests

🟫 Final Days (36–40): Buffer & confidence

Tester scripts

Memory checks

Clean code

Rest 😄

3. Daily work structure (THIS is key)

Every day, follow this ritual:

1️⃣ Define ONE daily goal

❌ “Work on execution”
✅ “Handle output redirection without leaks”

Write it down before coding.

2️⃣ Time-box your session

2–4 hours focused

No jumping files randomly

3️⃣ End every day with:

A working commit

A TODO for tomorrow

Example:

TODO:
- handle heredoc in pipes
- fix exit status in builtin fork


This removes anxiety when you stop.

4. Suggested file structure
src/
├── env/
│   ├── env_init.c
│   ├── env_utils.c
│   ├── env_export.c
│   └── env_unset.c
├── builtins/
│   ├── echo.c
│   ├── cd.c
│   ├── pwd.c
│   ├── exit.c
│   └── builtins.c
├── exec/
│   ├── exec.c
│   ├── pipes.c
│   ├── redirs.c
│   └── path.c


Isolation = clarity.

5. How to feel progress every day

You’ll feel progress when:

Something new works

Something complex became simple

Something got deleted/refactored

If a day is “just refactor”, that still counts.

Final reassurance ❤️

Minishell is not about being fast.
It’s about building confidence in systems programming.

If you want, next we can:

Build a checklist per builtin

Or design your execution flow diagram

Or review your current structure and refactor it together

You’re not behind — you’re exactly where minishell wants you to be.
